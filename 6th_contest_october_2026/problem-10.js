/* Sum the Main and Secondary Diagonals */
/* Given a square 2D array matrix of numbers, write a function diagonalSums that returns an object containing two properties: main (the sum of elements on the main diagonal) and secondary (the sum of elements on the secondary diagonal).

The main diagonal runs from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner (matrix[i][i]). The secondary diagonal runs from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner (matrix[i][n - 1 - i]). If the matrix has odd dimensions, the center element is part of both diagonals and should be included in both sums.

Examples
Example 1
diagonalSums([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]);
// Returns: { main: 15, secondary: 15 }
Example 2
diagonalSums([
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
]);
// Returns: { main: 5, secondary: 5 }
Example 1
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

Output: {"main":15,"secondary":15}

Explanation: Main diagonal: 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. Secondary diagonal: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.

Example 2
Input: matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]

Output: {"main":5,"secondary":5}

Explanation: Main diagonal: 1 + 4 = 5. Secondary diagonal: 2 + 3 = 5.

Constraints
matrix is an N x N 2D array where 0 <= N <= 100
Each matrix element is a number between -1000 and 1000 */

//SOLUTION
function diagonalSums(matrix) {
    let mainSum = 0;
    let secondarySum = 0;
    const n = matrix.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Main diagonal element: row i, column i
        mainSum += matrix[i][i];
        
        // Secondary diagonal element: row i, column n - 1 - i
        secondarySum += matrix[i][n - 1 - i];
    }

    return {
        main: mainSum,
        secondary: secondarySum
    };
}

//TEST

console.log(diagonalSums([
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
])); 
// Output: { main: 15, secondary: 15 }

console.log(diagonalSums([
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4]
])); 
// Output: { main: 5, secondary: 5 }
