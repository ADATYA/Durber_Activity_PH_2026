/* Greatest Common Divisor */

/*Write a function gcd that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers a and b.

The greatest common divisor is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

If one of the numbers is 0 and the other is positive, their GCD is the positive number.
If both numbers are 0, return 0.
Examples
gcd(12, 18);
// 6
gcd(7, 13);
// 1
Example 1
Input: a = 12, b = 18

Output: 6

Explanation: 6 is the largest integer that divides both 12 and 18.

Example 2
Input: a = 7, b = 13

Output: 1

Explanation: 7 and 13 are coprime, so their GCD is 1.

Constraints
0 <= a, b <= 10^9

 */

//SOLUTION:

function gcd(a, b) {
    // The Euclidean algorithm continues until b becomes 0
    while (b !== 0) {
        let temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}
